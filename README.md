The purpose of this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City during August 2019, and present it to investors looking to begin a bikesharing program in Des Moinse, Iowa. The goal was to answer key questions like:
* Who uses bikeshare programs?
* Does gender play a role in bikesharing?
* What time of day are bikes most used?
* What areas of the city would see the most bikeshare usage?
