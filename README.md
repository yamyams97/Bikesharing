# Bikesharing with NYC CitiBike Data
An analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data, with Tableu.
## Overview
The Tableu story can bee seen with [this link](https://public.tableau.com/shared/429TRFX52?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

The purpose of this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City during August 2019, and present it to investors looking to begin a bikesharing program in Des Moinse, Iowa. The goal was to answer key questions like:
* Who uses bikeshare programs?
* Does gender play a role in bikesharing?
* What time of day are bikes most used?
* What areas of the city would see the most bikeshare usage?

## Results 
While the demographics of Des Moines is different than that of NYC, a look into the Citibike data is a good insight into potential bikesharing possibilities for all cities. Through the data, you see that over 3/4 of the user are actually subscibers to the program. We can also see that 1/4 of the users are female, and roughly 5/8 are male, and 1/8 of the gender is unknown. So males seem to favor bikesharing more than women. 

Based on location, the majority of the rideshare counts occured deep in the commercial part of Manhattan. Densely packed residential areas, skyscrapers, and entertainment venues all within close proximity would serve well for bikesharing opportunities. On the heatmap we created, we can see that bike usuage was highest during the weekdays, during the normal commute hours. We also see that the usual trip duration is less than and hour. 

## Summary 
In conclusion, bikesharing services would do well in busy metropolitan areas with densely packed residential areas. With parking being scarce, biking would be a great alternative. It also provides a great health promotional benefit, and could help decrease the rate of obesity in the city. When creating the bikeshare program, more outreach should be done towards female riders.
